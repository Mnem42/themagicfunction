# The magic function

Defines a class named `CodeRunner` in various languages to magically do whatever
your code needs to do. This class contains two public functions: `run_code_cli`
and `run_code_gui`. These run the code as a cli or gui, respectively.

## How to use

### Python

For an interactive demo, run `python/magic_function.py`. To use it as a library,
use `import magic_function.py`.
